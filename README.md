# MicroShop - Microfrontend Architecture Showcase

![CI](https://github.com/jonasmessias/microfrontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://jonasmessias.github.io/react-microfrontend/)**

A practical demonstration of **microfrontend architecture** applied to an e-commerce scenario, implemented with **Webpack Module Federation** and **React 18**.

## About the Project

This is a **technical showcase** demonstrating the implementation of microfrontends in a real-world e-commerce context. The goal is to illustrate how different teams can develop and deploy features independently while maintaining a seamless user experience.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**

- Module Federation for runtime code sharing
- Independent development and deployment of each microfrontend
- Shared state between applications via Zustand
- Decoupled communication via EventBus (CustomEvents)
